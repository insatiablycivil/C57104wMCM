Description: Applies a simplified version of the IEEE C57.104-2019 DGA 
    Screening Methodology with added uncertainty propagation via a Monte Carlo
    Method (MCM). It will output the per-gas DGA Status and Combined DGA Status 
    as well as an estimated probability of each given outcomes based on the 
    MCM. There is an optional Diagnostic step that will apply a combination of
    Duval Triangles 1|4|5 (C57.104 Tables 6, D.3, and D.4, respectively), 
    Rogers Ratio (C57.104 Table 5), and IEC 60599(2022) Tables 1|2 to the 
    samples. It will provide diagnostics split in accordance to the Screening 
    outputs. As a reminder, the IEEE Screening Methodology generally recommends
    diagnostics only for a DGA Status of 2 or 3. The function will attempt to
    use all gas samples provided; i.e., not limit Table 4 to 3-6 samples. A 
    Normal, Triangular, or Uniform distribution shape may be selected. If the 
    first, the uncertainty inputted is assumed to represent a 95% probability 
    level. If the latter two, then the uncertainty is assumed to represent a 
    100% probability level. Accuracy is interpretted  as a 0-1 %-equivalent of
    the gas sample value whereas the minimum accuracy is interpretted as 
    absolute values in PPM. If desired, a correlation can be added across gases
    (i.e. within a given sample). This can be either as a rho or a correlation 
    matrix. Please refer to my thesis as to some of the limitations, namely the
    omission of correlations across samples to accommodate the Accuracy and 
    Reproducibility as defined by ISO 5725 + IEC 60567.
