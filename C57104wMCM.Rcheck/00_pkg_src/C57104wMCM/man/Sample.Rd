\usage{
Sample(
  gas_data,
  limit_data,
  accuracy,
  min_accuracy,
  distribution_shape,
  rho,
  cor_mat,
  n,
  col_names,
  sd_data
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gas_data}{Data.frame: First column containing days since oldest sample. Rest of columns containing sample value in PPM.}

\item{limit_data}{Data.frame: Columns containing the IEEE DGA Table limits for each gas. Each Table is on its own row; four rows expected. Caution: Table 4 is expressed as PPM/Day!}

\item{accuracy}{Named Numeric: Values to be multiplied by gas value to give uncertainty. Can either be same value for all gases, or individual values for each gas. Expected range: 0-1.}

\item{min_accuracy}{Named Numeric: Absolute Values (PPM) used as minimum uncertainty. Can either be same value for all gases, or individual values for each gas.}

\item{distribution_shape}{Numeric: Distribution shape representing uncertainty. 1 = Normal, 2 = Triangular, 3 = Uniform. If Normal, Accuracy is interpreted as 95\% confidence interval, else as 100\%.}

\item{rho}{Numeric: Value representing rho for correlations. Can either be same value for all gases, or individual values for each gas. NA if using \code{cor_mat} instead.}

\item{cor_mat}{Numeric Matrix: Values representing correlation matrix. NA if using \code{rho} instead.}

\item{n}{Numeric: Number of samples to generate for the Monte Carlo for each gas.}

\item{col_names}{Strings: Gas Names. Order must match other named variables throughout. Expected a subset of <H2|CH4|C2H6|C2H4|C2H2|CO|CO2>.}

\item{sd_data}{Data.frame: First column containing days since oldest sample. Rest of columns containing standard deviation for sample value in PPM.}
